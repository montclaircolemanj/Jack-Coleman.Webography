 style="font-family: Century Schoolbook;">There is plenty to hear in this site about the history of special effects and how the film industry went from using practical effects to becoming dominated by CGI. In the past, special effects were mostly acheived by crafting with various materials and objects, non-human entities were brought to life via animatronics, puppets and props, and sets were physical structures constructed by the crew. Now non-human creatures are mostly crafted through motion capture, and other special effects and sets are now constructed via computer generated effects. Films like Avatar and those of the Marvel Cinematic Universe are among those mentioned that almost completely utilize these two technological methods.</span><br>

      <td style="vertical-align: top; font-family: Century Schoolbook;"><big><small>The site here speaks of the history of animation mediums and the new inventions to innovate the medium. It discusses the many methods to create animations and how their respective processes work. These methods consist of traditionally hand drawn animation, computer animation (both 2D and 3D) and stop motion animation. As for the mechanical techniques, it looks into rotoscoping (the process of tracing live action footage frame by frame to make realistic animation), motion capture and the multiplane camera (many backgrounds are placed on top of one another and are panned along at different speeds to emulate a 3D environment despite being 2D).</small><br>

      <td style="vertical-align: top; font-family: Century Schoolbook;"><big><small>According to this site, animation can also be an effect of its own. Films like Mary Poppins and Who Framed Roger Rabbit were two prominent examples of films that mixed animation with live action. It also makes note of how this technique is almost as old as film itself, first being pioneered by Max Fleischer with his Out of the Inkwell cartoons, and then by Walt Disney with his Alice Comedies. Stop motion was another way to accomplish this, in fact, this was one of the common practical effects to bring supernatural entities to the real world. While it was already mentioned before, it makes repeats how motion capture took hold as the standard way to create creatures in live action environments. Going back to traditional animation/live action, while this process has become a rare breed, it has still appeared from time to time recently in films like Mary Poppins Returns.</small><br>
