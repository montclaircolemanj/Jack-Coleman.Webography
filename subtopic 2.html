 style="font-family: Century Schoolbook;">For those unfamiliar with the film editing process, this site will come in handy. It covers the basics and tips you will need to consider such as continuity editing, establishing shots, transitions that cut and fade and more. In addition, it attempts to get the viewer to seriously consider these methods, otherwise their footage will not enact the feeling that was intended. It does this by listing four guiding principles to formulate one's narrative. Those being continuity, pacing, emotion and information. If anyone wished to get started on the editing process, this site has them covered by listing editing softwares such as Adobe Premiere Pro and Final Cut Pro.</span><br>

      <td style="vertical-align: top; font-family: Century Schoolbook;"><big><small>Here, the history of editing a film is covered. Films weren't always edited on a technological screen as they are now, they used to be edited directly onto the tapes themselves for example through cutting and dissolving into the next scene. Along with film editing, there is also mention of the birth of several shots to give more depth to characters and settings during the silent era. Going forward into the 1980s, there would come a new method of editing which would involved digitally editing a collection of clips without physically trimming the footage. The old methods of editing haven't died out, as traditional physical spicing is still in use today according to this site.</small><br>
